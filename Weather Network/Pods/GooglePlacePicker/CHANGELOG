Version 2.0.0 - July 2016
=========================

Improvements:
  ! This release splits the Places API from the Maps SDK. Previously, if you
    wanted to use the Places API you had to include all of GoogleMaps. As a
    result of the split, the final size of the Places API binary is 70% smaller
    than the previous combined binary. If you are using only the Maps SDK you
    will not be affected unless you have pinned your dependency on GoogleMaps
    to a version earlier than 2.0. In this case, you should update this
    restriction in your Podfile. If you are using the Places API, see the
    migration guide online for more details.

Resolved Issues:
  - The Places framework is now available as a download for manual installation.
    For details, see the get started guide online.
  - The Places API no longer requests permission to access the user's location
    on behalf of the app. This means that existing code which calls
    GMSPlacesClient.currentPlaceWithCallback(_:) must be updated to ensure that
    the location permission has been granted beforehand.
